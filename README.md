Using the website:

	  From the form in the middle, you can set yourself alarms. Ticks below show which information you want to hear.
  	You can set an alarm to 2077 but you can't set a nameless alarm!
  	On the right side, there will be instant notifications about a pre-chosen filter. Guess who picks the filter! Yes you...
  	You can click the little x's on notification or alarm's corners to delete them.
  	Yes, I could've put some links that direct you to the original news, but I couldn't make it...
